    track exist together. Data track is first. Commonly used as game CDs in
    the 1990s and 2000s.

    Enhanced CD (Blue Book): multisession, first session only contains audio
    tracks, second session contains one data track. The data track usually
    contains music videos or other bonus materials. "Copy Control" CDs fall
    into this category as well.

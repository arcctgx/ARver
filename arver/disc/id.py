    Return FreeDB disc ID as 8-digit hex string.

    The first argument is the list of LBA offsets of all tracks from all CD
    sessions, regardless of their types. Specifically, for Enhanced CDs the
    list MUST include the offset of the data track from the second session.

    Including the track from the second session is crucial. discid module
    ignores the second session when reading a physical CD, and returns a
    FreeDB ID incompatile with one used by AccurateRip database.

    Return MusicBrainz disc ID as a string.

    The first argument is the list of LBA offsets of all tracks in the first
    CD session. This means that for Mixed Mode CDs the data track offset MUST
    be included, but in Enhanced CDs it MUST NOT, because it belongs to the
    second session. For Enhanced CDs this will effectively be the list of all
    audio track offsets, just like for regular Audio CDs.

    The second argument is the total length of the first CD session in sectors,
    including lead in. This is equivalent to LBA lead out offset in Audio and
    Mixed Mode CDs, but not in Enhanced CDs.

# ARver

`ARver` is a command-line program for verifying audio tracks ripped from a CD
against checksums stored in AccurateRip database.

The idea behind AccurateRip verification is that it's virtually impossible to
get exact same errors when ripping different copies of the same CD on various
CD drives. If the copies are scratched or otherwise degraded, read errors will
occur in different disc sectors. CD drive defects are unlikely to manifest in
the same way on different machines. Essentially, all read errors are expected
to be unique, but in absence of errors only a single correct result exists.

AccurateRip database stores track checksums submitted by multiple users. When
many users rip the same disc without errors, same checksums are submitted to
the database repeatably, boosting their "confidence" statistic. If a checksum
of a ripped track is not found in the database, it indicates that the track has
not been ripped correctly. Since the result is unique, disc read errors likely
occurred while ripping.

`ARver` calculates the AccurateRip checksums of local files, fetches checksums
for a given CD from the database, and displays a report which compares them.

## Usage example

This example demonstrates the typical use case of `arver`: verification of
files just ripped from a CD.

![Animated ARver usage example](doc/arver_usage.gif)

The tracks have been ripped using `cdparanoia` prior to running `arver`.
AccurateRip disc ID is calculated based on the TOC of the CD which still is
in the drive. `arver` fetches the checksums from the database, and compares
checksums of local files with database entries.

In this case `arver` found that the last track was not ripped correctly, and
reports an error. The CD is affected by [disc rot], and `cdparanoia` reported
multiple issues toward the end of the third track.

## Installation

For typical use:

```sh
python3 -m pip install arver
```

Wheels are provided for `x86_64` architecture `CPython` versions from 3.7 to
3.11. For other platforms and Python versions only installation from the source
distribution is supported (see "Dependencies" section below).

For development:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/arcctgx/ARver
cd ARver
python3 -m pip install --editable .
```

For packaging:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/arcctgx/ARver
cd ARver
python3 setup.py install --root=/tmp/pkg-arver
# use contents of /tmp/pkg-arver to create a package.
```

### Dependencies

`ARver` depends on following Python packages at runtime:

* `discid`
* `musicbrainzngs`
* `pycdio`
* `requests`

They will be installed automatically by `pip install` if needed. Alternatively,
one can install them using provided `requirements.txt` file.

The source code includes a `C` extension which depends on `libsndfile`, so
building from source requires a `C` compiler (`gcc`) and `libsndfile` headers.
This makes `libsndfile` both compile-time and runtime dependency when `ARver`
is installed from the source distribution.

## Features

The package provides following command-line tools:

* `arver`: the main program. It determines the AccurateRip disc ID, fetches
AccurateRip data, calculates checksums of ripped WAV files, compares them
with downloaded AccurateRip data and displays the result.

* `arver-discinfo`: displays disc IDs and the Table of Contents, fetches and
displays all AccurateRip track checksums.

* `arver-ripinfo`: calculates checksums of WAV files (ARv1, ARv2 and CRC32)
and presents them as a table.

* `arver-bin-parser`: parses cached binary AccurateRip response and displays
all AccurateRip track checksums.

### Planned features

Several features are planned, but not implemented yet:

* FLAC format support (only WAV format is supported now)
* mixed-mode CD support (disc type is recognized, but verification fails)
* offset detection (zero offset is assumed)

### Restrictions

#### Using MusicBrainz disc IDs instead of physical discs

The regular use case of `ARver` is to verify a set of audio files right after
they have been ripped, while the CD they have been ripped from is still in the
drive.

Commands `arver` and `arver-discinfo` support an alternative mode of operation,
where disc information is downloaded from MusicBrainz by disc ID lookup. While
this can be useful, it is reliable only for Audio CDs. Information about data
tracks is not encoded in MusicBrainz disc ID, but it is necessary to calculate
AccurateRip disc ID. Attempts to verify discs with data tracks (e.g. Enhanced
CDs) using disc ID lookup may not work at all, result in false negatives or low
confidence values.

#### Verifying Copy Controlled CDs

Copy Controlled CDs were designed specifically to prevent ripping. The way it
is achieved makes these discs more sensitive to normal wear, and makes them
not compliant with CD audio standard. Such CDs can often be ripped, but are
much more likely to produce errors.

These CDs appear to `arver` and `arver-discinfo` as ordinary Enhanced CDs
(multisession with data track in the end). It is not possible to distinguish
them from normal Enhanced CDs based on the table of contents alone. If your
disc bears "Copy Controlled CD" logo, verification problems are expected.
